    Third is after the changes have been made to the project, type "git add ." to post the changes made to a staging area. It is wise to add some comments with your commit so type "git commit -m" to commit your changes as well as inform the viewer of the changes made.
    Fourth is after all commits have been submitted, use “git push origin <your-branch-name>” to push the changed project back to the github repository and be sure to refresh the page.
    Fifth is to add your TL as a collaborator to the repo through the settings tab. Click the manage access tab then click the invite collaborators button. Add the TL's name or email.
    Sixth is to make a pull request in the homepage of the repo. Click compare and pull request. Click the new pull request button. Click the dropdown labeled base repository and change it to your repository.
    Seventh is to add a subject and message of the changes made to the project. Click the create pull request. That is the final step.
